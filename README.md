A little bit about me: I am from Boston, MA, and have a sister who also went to Lehigh but now lives in New York City. I previously went to Fordham University but decided to transfer after my sophomore year there. I went abroad to Barcelona, Spain last semester and loved it. Going abroad was an amazing experience, and I am so thankful that I was able to do it!
