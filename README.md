### I am a Journalism and Marketing student at [Lehigh University](https://www2.lehigh.edu/)

Here is my [Linked In](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gemma-pierpont-342640244/)

I am currently a reporter at [The Brown and White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/)

Here is my photography [portfolio](https://gempierpont.wixsite.com/gpierpontphotography)!

A little bit about me: I am from Boston, MA, and have a sister who also went to Lehigh but now lives in New York City. I previously went to Fordham University but decided to transfer after my sophomore year there. I went abroad to Barcelona, Spain last semester and loved it. Going abroad was an amazing experience, and I am so thankful that I was able to do it!

Here is an infographic I made in class about Lehigh's fall 2024 demographics:

## An Infographic on the Major Reasons for Not Attending College: 
![not attending college](https://github.com/gempierpont/gempierpont.github.io/blob/main/College%20Dropout%20(1).jpg?raw=true)

When looking for data that I found interesting, I found [this article](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/11/08/whats-behind-the-growing-gap-between-men-and-women-in-college-completion/) published on the Pew Research Center's website and written by Kim Parker. I am about to graduate college, so I thought that looking into reasons not to attend college would be thought-provoking for me. This article first discussed the gap between men and women and their college completion. The data found that women are more likely to be enrolled in a four-year college than men. The second part of this article discussed the major reasons for not attending college, from both men and women ages 25 and older. This data is what I focused on. It found that the main reason was that they couldn't afford to attend a four-year degree. 44% of women and 39% of men say they cannot afford college. Men are more likely than women to have more personal reasons for not attending college. 34% of men gave the reason that they just didn't want to attend college, and 26% said they didn't need more education for the job or career they wanted. The article also briefly touched on the topic of differences in racial and ethnic groups and attending college. It said that Hispanic adults (52%) are more likely to say they cannot afford college, compared to those who are White (39%) or Black (41%). Overall, this article was very interesting to me, especially as I get ready to leave college and start the post-grad life.

# Timeline of SKIMS: "How Kim Kardashian's SKIMS Went From a Passion Project to a $4 Billion Company"

I chose to cover the quick and immense success that SKIMS has had in a relatively short amount of time (2019-2023 to become a $4 Billion company). I liked how the article I chose gave both the ups and downs of the company, starting from the controversy with the original name to becoming the official underwear of the NBA, WNBA, and USA Basketball. I like that Kim Kardashian started this influencial brand because she has become an icon for her own shape. This clothing brand resonates with her own personal brand, and I think it made the company even more successful. This shapewear company has broadened perfectly into comfortable underwear and loungewear. I especially like this brand because of its advertising - they know their target audience and how to keep them engaged. 


## Here is my bar chart I created in Chartbuilder during our class practice:

## I created a bar chart about the different percentages of Greek Life that different colleges have. 

![greek life](https://github.com/gempierpont/gempierpont.github.io/blob/main/College_Greek_Life_Percentages_Fraternity_Sorority_chartbuilder.png?raw=true)

The data I chose was given to me from the "College Transitions" website, but the data was from the College Data Set forms and informational websites. I thought this data set was interesting because as someone who is not in Greek Life, it feels so big here, when in reality, sororities take up 26% of the female population and fraternities take up 18% of the male population. I was curious about different colleges because I wondered if it was the same case. I have a friend who goes to Wake Forest University, and her sorority is her entire experience at college. I can see how that happens because sororities take up 64% of the female population there. There are more girls in sororities than girls who are not. For this assignment, I decided to choose the chart grid option rather than the XY chart because I had two factors (fraternity and sorority). I randomly chose 28 colleges from the list that answered "yes" to having both fraternities and sororities. Also, putting the colleges on the bottom created a mess of words that were not legible.
