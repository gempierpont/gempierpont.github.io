### I am a Journalism and Marketing student at [Lehigh University](https://www2.lehigh.edu/)

I am currently a reporter at [The Brown and White](https://thebrownandwhite.com/)

Here is my photography [portfolio](https://gempierpont.wixsite.com/gpierpontphotography)!

A little bit about me: I am from Boston, MA, and have a sister who also went to Lehigh but now lives in New York City. I previously went to Fordham University but decided to transfer after my sophomore year there. I went abroad to Barcelona, Spain last semester and loved it. Going abroad was an amazing experience, and I am so thankful that I was able to do it!

Here is an infographic I made in class about Lehigh's fall 2024 demographics:

Here is an infographic I created for homework:

When looking for data that I found interesting, I found [this article](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/11/08/whats-behind-the-growing-gap-between-men-and-women-in-college-completion/) published on the Pew Research Center's website and written by Kim Parker. I am about to graduate college, so I thought that looking into reasons not to attend college would be thought-provoking for me. This article first discussed the gap between men and women and their college completion. The data found that women are more likely to be enrolled in a four-year college than men. The second part of this article discussed the major reasons for not attending college, from both men and women ages 25 and older. This data is what I focused on. It found that the main reason was that they couldn't afford to attend a four-year degree. 44% of women and 39% of men say they cannot afford college. Men are more likely than women to have more personal reasons for not attending college. 34% of men gave the reason that they just didn't want to attend college, and 26% said they didn't need more education for the job or career they wanted. The article also briefly touched on the topic of differences in racial and ethnic groups and attending college. It said that Hispanic adults (52%) are more likely to say they cannot afford college, compared to those who are White (39%) or Black (41%). Overall, this article was very interesting to me, especially as I get ready to leave college and start the post-grad life.
